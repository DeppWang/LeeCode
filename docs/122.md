# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### 思路

- 找到最优解
- 找规律：在降之前卖掉，再买？规律就是：只要在降之前卖了就能达到最优解。这个规律应该有个数学术语！数学术语叫：正数增益？

```
[7,1,4,3,6,8] 3 + 5 
[7,1,4,3,6,9] 3 + 6
[7,1,5,3,6,20] 4 + 17
[7,6,8,3,6,9,5,10,2,15] 2 + 6 + 5 + 13
```

### 代码

```Python
# Python3
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                res = prices[i] - prices[i-1] + res
        return res     
```

```Java
// Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
                res = prices[i] - prices[i-1] + res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
